1) Introduction [X]

2) How The Internet Works

	
- Browsing the Web


ISP = Internet Service Provider
DNS = Domain Name Server (A phonebook which has a list of all the URLS and the addresses of them) 
IP Address = Anything that is connected to the internet has an IP address
Servers = Computers with a piece of software where it knows how to send you files when requested
Browser = A tool that can receive files from servers and knows how to read and display them

When searching Google.com:
 
Search on Browser ->  
Goes to ISP -> 
Goes to DNS -> 
Sends IP Address to ISP -> 
IP Address to Browser ->
Browser Sends IP Address to Google Servers ->
Google servers send text files to Browser (HTML, CSS, Javascript) ->
Browser displays the files


- Breaking Google

-> View
-> Developer
-> Developer Tools

Or right click -> "Inspect Element"

Click Icon on left with pointer and window (element selector), you can then click different elements on the webpage and read and change the code on the Google website.

When we refresh, our changes do not stick. If you look at our request example, we already have the files in our browser, but once we refresh, the browser asks the servers again.


- The Internet Backbone 

= A global network of cables that physically connects the global internet 

Router ->
Modem ->
Signal Towers/Wirless Transmitter ->
Phyiscal Cables connecting it globally

- Traceroute

Within terminal, type traceroute google.com this will show you the number of hops (stops) to get to the final address (Google.com)

Each hop shows different computers your request goes through to bring you Google.com

Terminal = name of a terminal emulator
Command Shell = name of the tool to access different commands
Command Prompt App = Tool that allows you to type commands to the command shell, and view the text it prints as it runs



Windows has two command shells

- Command Prompt/Shell: Their legacy shell abberviated as CMD
- Powershell: Their better shell

MacOS and Linux use a different command shell:

- BASH (Bourne Again Shell)
